# About

The messaging app Telegram has a Bot API and platform for third-party developers to create bots, which are Telegram accounts operated by software. One of the main projects that I'm working on now is the Telegram Bot for my class.

The bot can be accessed [here](https://telegram.me/threeoheight_bot).
